# Angular — Routing

Official docs: https://angular.dev/guide/routing

## What is routing?

Routing lets you navigate between pages without reloading the browser. Each URL shows a different component.

## Define routes

> Route paths do NOT start with `/` in `app.routes.ts` — Angular adds the slash automatically when it matches a URL.

```typescript
// app.routes.ts
export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: DashboardPage },
  { path: 'add', component: AddTransactionPage },
];
```

### Default route and wildcard — always add these

Every app needs two extra routes:

**Default route** — redirect the user when they first open the app at `/`. Use `redirectTo` to send them to the right starting page (for example, the login page or dashboard).

```typescript
{ path: '', redirectTo: 'login', pathMatch: 'full' }
```

**Why `pathMatch: 'full'`?** By default, Angular matches routes by prefix — it checks if the URL _starts with_ the path. An empty string `''` is a prefix of every URL, so without `pathMatch: 'full'`, `path: ''` would match `/dashboard`, `/login`, and everything else, redirecting the user to login no matter what page they visit.

`pathMatch: 'full'` tells Angular to only match when the entire URL is exactly `''`.

| URL          | without `pathMatch: 'full'` | with `pathMatch: 'full'` |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/`          | matches ✓                   | matches ✓                |
| `/dashboard` | matches ✓ (wrong!)          | does not match ✓         |
| `/login`     | matches ✓ (wrong!)          | does not match ✓         |

You only need `pathMatch: 'full'` on `path: ''`. All other routes are specific enough that prefix matching works correctly.

**Wildcard route** — catches any URL that does not match any route (e.g. `/xyz`). Without it, Angular shows a blank page for unknown URLs.

```typescript
{ path: '**', redirectTo: 'login' }
```

> The wildcard `**` must always be **last** in the array. Angular checks routes in order — if `**` were first, it would match everything and no other route would ever load.

A complete routes file looks like this:

```typescript
export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'login', pathMatch: 'full' }, // default → redirect
  { path: 'login', component: LoginPage },
  { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardPage },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: 'login' }, // unknown URL → redirect
];
```

## RouterOutlet — where Angular renders the active page

```html
<!-- app.html -->
<router-outlet />
```

## routerLink — navigate declaratively in the template

Use `routerLink` on any element to navigate when the user clicks it. It does not reload the browser — Angular handles the navigation internally.

### Import in the component first

```typescript
imports: [RouterLink];
```

### Static route

```html
<a routerLink="/">Dashboard</a>
<a routerLink="/add">Add transaction</a>

<!-- also works on divs, buttons, etc -->
<button routerLink="/add">Add</button>
```

### Dynamic route — with a parameter

First, define the route parameter in `app.routes.ts`:

```typescript
{ path: 'detail/:id', component: MealDetailPage }
```

Then, navigate to it with `[routerLink]`:

> When using `[routerLink]` with an array, the first item IS the path and it DOES need `/`. This is different from `app.routes.ts` where you never add `/`.

```html
<!-- navigates to /detail/52772 -->
<div [routerLink]="['/detail', meal.idMeal]">{{ meal.strMeal }}</div>
```

First item is the path, second is the value for `:id`.

`routerLink` — static path, written as a string

`[routerLink]` — dynamic path, written as an array with property binding

## Router service — navigate programmatically from TypeScript

```typescript
private router = inject(Router);

onSubmit() {
  // after saving, go back to the dashboard
  this.router.navigate(['/dashboard']); // takes an array — each path segment is one element
}
```

Use this when you need to navigate after an action (form submit, delete, etc).

### Programmatic vs declarative navigation

Both do the same thing — navigate to a URL. The difference is WHERE you call them.

| Approach            | Where                  | When to use                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `routerLink`        | Template (HTML)        | Links and buttons that always navigate to the same place |
| `Router.navigate()` | TypeScript (component) | After an action — submit a form, delete a record, log in |

### Location.back() — go to the previous page

`Location` (from `@angular/common`) lets you navigate to the previous page in the browser history — the same as clicking the browser back button.

```typescript
import { Location } from '@angular/common';

private location = inject(Location);

goBack() {
  this.location.back();
}
```

```html
<button (click)="goBack()">Back</button>
```

Use `Location.back()` when you want a back button inside your app (for example, on a detail page).

---

## Route parameters — dynamic segments

You have already seen route parameters briefly in the `routerLink` section. Here they are explained in more detail — how to define them, and how to read them inside a component.

A route parameter is a part of the URL that changes. Define it with `:` in `app.routes.ts`:

```typescript
{ path: 'detail/:id', component: MealDetailPage }
```

`/detail/52772` and `/detail/53049` both match this route. `52772` becomes the value of `id`.

Route parameters always come as `string` — even if the value looks like a number. Keep your service methods typed as `string`.

### Route params vs query params

|         | Route param                     | Query param                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| URL     | `/detail/52772`                 | `/detail?id=52772`            |
| Use for | Identity — which specific item  | Filters, pagination, sorting  |
| Example | `/users/victor`, `/products/42` | `/products?page=2&sort=price` |

### Dynamic routerLink

When the route has a parameter, use an array in `routerLink`:

The path goes in quotes (`'/detail'`) because it is a literal string. The variable goes without quotes (`meal.idMeal`) because it is evaluated as JavaScript — Angular reads its value at runtime.

```html
<div [routerLink]="['/detail', meal.idMeal]">...</div>
```

First item is the path, second is the value for `:id`.

### Read the parameter — ActivatedRoute

To read a route parameter inside a component, you need three things:

1. Inject `ActivatedRoute` — the service that gives you access to the current URL
2. Read the param in `ngOnInit` — route params are only available after the component is created, not in the constructor
3. Call a method with the param — keeps `ngOnInit` clean, one method per job

**Why `ngOnInit` and not the constructor?**
The constructor runs when Angular creates the class — at that point, the routing system has not yet attached the URL data to the component. `ngOnInit` runs after Angular finishes setting up the component, including injecting the route. That is why route params are always read in `ngOnInit`.

The full pattern:

```typescript
private route = inject(ActivatedRoute);
private mealService = inject(MealService);
meal = signal<Meal | null>(null); // signal because the template needs to react when data arrives

ngOnInit(): void {
  const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id'); // plain const — not a signal
  this.loadMeal(id as string);
}

// If the id can change without leaving the page — use paramMap.subscribe instead:
ngOnInit(): void {
  this.route.paramMap.subscribe((params) => {
    const id = params.get('id');
    this.loadMeal(id as string);
  });
}

loadMeal(id: string): void { // separate method to keep ngOnInit clean
  this.mealService.getMealById(id).subscribe({
    next: (response) => {
      this.meal.set(response.meals[0]);
    },
    error: (err) => {
      console.error(err);
    }
  });
}
```

- `id` is a plain `const` — not a signal. The user cannot change the id while on this page because navigating to a different id creates a new component instance. If you had a "next/previous" button that changed the id without leaving the page, then you would need a signal or subscribe to `paramMap` instead of using `snapshot`.
- `loadMeal()` is a separate method — keeps `ngOnInit` clean, one method per job

---

### `snapshot` vs `subscribe`

Two ways to read a route parameter:

**`snapshot` — read once when the component loads**

```typescript
const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
```

Use this when the component is destroyed when the user navigates away — which is the standard case.

**`subscribe` — react every time the param changes**

```typescript
this.route.paramMap.subscribe((params) => {
  const id = params.get('id');
  this.loadMeal(id as string);
});
```

Use this when the component stays alive and the param can change — for example a "next / previous" button that changes the id without leaving the page.

In most cases `snapshot` is correct.

### `.params` vs `.paramMap`

|                 | `.params`                      | `.paramMap`                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Returns         | Plain object `{ id: '52772' }` | `ParamMap` object with helper methods |
| Read value      | `params['id']`                 | `params.get('id')`                    |
| Check if exists | Manual                         | `params.has('id')`                    |
| Recommended     | No — older API                 | Yes — use this                        |

---

## Query params — optional extras in the URL

Query params are the key=value pairs after a `?` in a URL, like `/employees?status=active`. They are optional and do not affect which route loads.

Use query params for **filters, sorting, and pagination** — not for identity.

| Type | URL example | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Route param | `/employees/42` | Which specific item |
| Query param | `/employees?status=active` | Filters, sorting, optional state |

### Add query params to a routerLink

Use `[queryParams]` alongside `[routerLink]` or `routerLink`:

```html
<!-- navigate to /employees?status=active -->
<mat-card routerLink="/employees" [queryParams]="{ status: 'active' }">
  Active Employees
</mat-card>
```

`[queryParams]` takes an object. Multiple params are also supported: `{ status: 'active', page: '2' }`.

### Read query params in the target component

In the component that receives the navigation, read query params in `ngOnInit` with `ActivatedRoute.snapshot.queryParamMap`:

```typescript
private route = inject(ActivatedRoute);

ngOnInit(): void {
  const status = this.route.snapshot.queryParamMap.get('status');
  if (status) {
    this.selectedStatus.set(status);
  }
}
```

- `queryParamMap.get('key')` — returns `string | null`
- `paramMap.get('key')` — for route params like `/detail/:id`
- `queryParamMap` — for query params like `?status=active`

Do not confuse them — they are separate.

### When to use `snapshot` vs `subscribe`

`snapshot` is correct for query params that come from a navigation (dashboard → employees). Use `subscribe` only if the params can change while the component stays alive (rare).

## Route guards — protect routes

A route guard is a function that runs before Angular loads a route. It decides if the user is allowed to enter.

Official docs: https://angular.dev/guide/routing/common-router-tasks#preventing-unauthorized-access

### When to use

- User tries to visit `/dashboard` without being logged in → redirect to `/login`
- User tries to visit `/admin` without the admin role → redirect to `/dashboard`

### The modern pattern — `CanActivateFn`

Generate the guard with the CLI:

```bash
ng generate guard core/guards/auth
```

Angular v15+ uses plain functions instead of classes. No `@Injectable`, no class — just a function.

```typescript
// core/guards/auth.guard.ts
import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivateFn, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from '../services/auth.service';

export const authGuard: CanActivateFn = () => {
  const authService = inject(AuthService);
  const router = inject(Router);

  if (authService.isLoggedIn()) {
    return true;
  }

  return router.createUrlTree(['/login']);
};
```

- `inject()` works inside guard functions — same as in components
- Return `true` — route loads normally
- Return `router.createUrlTree(['/login'])` — redirects the user. Use this instead of `router.navigate()` because a guard must return a value synchronously (`boolean` or `UrlTree`). `router.navigate()` is async and designed for components — inside a guard it can cause the navigation to run twice.
- Do not use `return false` alone — it blocks the route but shows a blank page

### Apply the guard to a route

```typescript
// app.routes.ts
import { authGuard } from './core/guards/auth.guard';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardPage, canActivate: [authGuard] },
];
```

`canActivate` takes an array — you can stack multiple guards on the same route.

### `CanActivateFn` vs `CanActivate` (class-based — old)

|                     | `CanActivateFn` (modern) | `CanActivate` (old)  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Angular version     | v15+                     | Before v15           |
| Style               | Plain function           | Class with interface |
| Needs `@Injectable` | No                       | Yes                  |
| Recommended         | Yes                      | No — deprecated      |

### Role-based guard

Generate the guard with the CLI:

```bash
ng generate guard core/guards/admin
```

A second type of guard — checks not just _if_ the user is logged in, but _what role_ they have.

```typescript
// core/guards/admin-guard.ts
import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivateFn, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from '../services/auth.service';

export const adminGuard: CanActivateFn = () => {
  const authService = inject(AuthService);
  const router = inject(Router);

  return authService.getUserRole() === 'admin' ? true : router.createUrlTree(['/dashboard']);
};
```

Stack multiple guards on the same route — Angular runs them in order:

```typescript
{ path: 'admin', canActivate: [authGuard, adminGuard], loadComponent: ... }
```

`authGuard` runs first (is the user logged in?), then `adminGuard` (is the user an admin?). If either fails, the user is redirected.

### noAuthGuard — protect the login page from authenticated users

`authGuard` blocks unauthenticated users from entering protected pages.
`noAuthGuard` does the opposite — it blocks authenticated users from going back to the login page.

Without it, a logged-in user can press the browser back button and land on the login page — a confusing experience.

```typescript
// core/guards/no-auth-guard.ts
export const noAuthGuard: CanActivateFn = () => {
  const authService = inject(AuthService);
  const router = inject(Router);

  return authService.isLoggedIn() ? router.createUrlTree(['/dashboard']) : true;
};
```

Apply it to the login route:

```typescript
{ path: 'login', canActivate: [noAuthGuard], loadComponent: ... }
```

| Guard | Protects | Redirects to |
|---|---|---|
| `authGuard` | Protected pages | `/login` if not authenticated |
| `noAuthGuard` | Login page | `/dashboard` if already authenticated |

---

### Unused parameters in guards

The CLI generates guards with `(route, state)` parameters. If you do not use them, remove them — unused parameters add noise:

```typescript
// generated
export const adminGuard: CanActivateFn = (route, state) => { ... }

// cleaned up
export const adminGuard: CanActivateFn = () => { ... }
```

If you only use one, prefix the unused one with `_` to signal it is intentionally ignored:

```typescript
export const adminGuard: CanActivateFn = (_, state) => { ... }
```

---

## CanDeactivate guard — warn before leaving a page

Official docs: https://angular.dev/api/router/CanDeactivateFn

### What is it?

`CanActivate` runs **before entering** a route — it decides "can this user go here?"

`CanDeactivate` runs **before leaving** a route — it decides "can this user go away from here?"

The most common use: a routed form with unsaved changes. If the user tries to leave without saving, show a confirmation dialog.

### The key difference from CanActivate

`CanDeactivate` receives the **current component instance** as its first parameter. This is because the guard needs to check the component's state — for example, whether its form is dirty.

`CanActivate` only receives route info. `CanDeactivate` also receives the component being left.

### Generate the guard

```bash
ng generate guard core/guards/deactivate-guard
# select CanDeactivate when prompted
```

### The pattern

```typescript
import { CanDeactivateFn } from '@angular/router';
import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { map } from 'rxjs';
import { MatDialog } from '@angular/material/dialog';
import { DepartmentForm } from '../../pages/department-page/department-form/department-form';
import { ConfirmDialog } from '../../shared/components/confirm-dialog/confirm-dialog';

export const deactivateGuard: CanDeactivateFn<DepartmentForm> = (component) => {
  const dialog = inject(MatDialog);

  if (!component.departmentForm.dirty) {
    return true;
  }

  const dialogRef = dialog.open(ConfirmDialog, {
    width: '500px',
    autoFocus: false,
    data: {
      title: 'Unsaved changes',
      message: 'You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave?',
      cancelLabel: 'Stay',
      confirmLabel: 'Leave',
    },
  });

  return dialogRef.afterClosed().pipe(map((result) => !!result));
};
```

**Key points:**

- `inject()` goes at the **top of the function**, before any `if` — always
- `component` is not a signal — access its properties directly: `component.departmentForm.dirty`
- The component's form must not be `private` — the guard reads it from outside the class
- In TypeScript, a class can be used as a type: `CanDeactivateFn<DepartmentForm>` is valid

### Return values

| What the guard returns | What Angular does |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| `true` | Navigation happens |
| `false` | Navigation is blocked |
| `Observable<boolean>` | Angular waits for the observable to emit, then decides |

### Why return the observable instead of subscribing?

In a **component**, you call `.subscribe()` because you handle the value yourself.

In a **guard**, you **return the observable** — Angular subscribes to it internally and waits for the value. You do not call `.subscribe()`.

### Why `.pipe(map(result => !!result))`?

`afterClosed()` emits `true` when the user confirms, or `undefined` when they cancel (or close the dialog by clicking the backdrop or pressing Escape).

Angular needs a proper `boolean`. `!!` converts any value to boolean:

```
!!true      → true   (user confirmed → navigate)
!!undefined → false  (user cancelled → stay)
```

Without `map`, the observable emits `undefined` on cancel — Angular treats it as falsy but the return type is not clean.

### When does the dialog emit `undefined`?

- User clicks the **cancel button** (`mat-dialog-close` with no value)
- User clicks the **backdrop** (outside the dialog)
- User presses **Escape**

Only the confirm button emits `true` — because it calls `dialogRef.close(true)`.

### The successful save problem — markAsPristine()

After a successful submit, the form navigates away with `router.navigate()`. At that moment, `CanDeactivate` fires. The form is dirty (the user filled it in), so the guard would open the dialog — even though the user just saved.

Fix: call `this.departmentForm.markAsPristine()` **before** `router.navigate()`. This resets the dirty state. The guard sees the form as clean and returns `true` immediately.

```typescript
onSubmit() {
  if (this.departmentForm.valid) {
    // ... save logic ...
    this.departmentForm.markAsPristine(); // reset dirty state before navigating
    this.router.navigate(['departments']); // guard fires but sees clean form → allows
  }
}
```

### Apply the guard to a route

```typescript
// app.routes.ts
import { deactivateGuard } from './core/guards/deactivate-guard';

{
  path: 'departments/new',
  canDeactivate: [deactivateGuard],
  loadComponent: () => import('...').then((m) => m.DepartmentForm),
},
{
  path: 'departments/edit/:id',
  canDeactivate: [deactivateGuard],
  loadComponent: () => import('...').then((m) => m.DepartmentForm),
},
```

`canDeactivate` takes an array — same pattern as `canActivate`.

---

## Lazy loading

By default, Angular loads all route components at startup — even pages the user may never visit. Lazy loading fixes that: a component only loads when the user navigates to its route.

Use `loadComponent:` instead of `component:`:

The `.then()` call is needed because Angular uses **named exports** (`export class LoginPage`). You must extract the class by name. If you used a **default export** (`export default class LoginPage`) you could skip `.then()` — but Angular uses named exports by convention, so always include `.then()`.

```typescript
// component: — loads at startup (avoid in large apps)
{ path: 'login', component: LoginPage }

// loadComponent: with named export (Angular convention — always use this)
{ path: 'login', loadComponent: () => import('./pages/login-page/login-page').then(m => m.LoginPage) }

// loadComponent: with default export (less common — no .then() needed)
{ path: 'login', loadComponent: () => import('./pages/login-page/login-page') }
```

The arrow function is a **dynamic import** — Angular calls it only when needed.

When you switch to `loadComponent:`, remove the static import at the top of the file. The whole point is that Angular handles the import itself — keeping a static import defeats the purpose.

```typescript
// remove these when using loadComponent:
import { LoginPage } from './pages/login-page/login-page';
import { DashboardPage } from './pages/dashboard-page/dashboard-page';
```

Guards like `authGuard` stay as static imports — Angular needs them at startup to know which routes to protect.

A complete lazy-loaded routes file:

```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { authGuard } from './core/guards/auth-guard';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'login', pathMatch: 'full' },
  {
    path: 'login',
    loadComponent: () => import('./pages/login-page/login-page').then((m) => m.LoginPage),
  },
  {
    path: 'dashboard',
    canActivate: [authGuard],
    loadComponent: () =>
      import('./pages/dashboard-page/dashboard-page').then((m) => m.DashboardPage),
  },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: 'login' },
];
```
